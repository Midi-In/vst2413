VST2413 FM Synthesizer
======================

VST2413 is a software FM synthesizer based on YM2413 (OPLL) emulator.
YM2413 is well known as low-cost FM sound chip, and it was used on
Sega Master System and FM-PAC sound expansion cartridge for MSX.
VST2413 can resemble that warm texture of sound and may be well
suited for use in "16-bit style" chiptune music.

Current Restrictions
--------------------

VST2413 is currently under development and has many restrictions.

- Rhythm mode is not supported yet.
- Only for OS X. Windows support is in the plan for the future.
- VST plug-in only. No Audio Units support.
