VST2413 FM Synthesizer
======================

VST2413 is a software FM synthesizer based on YM2413 (OPLL) emulator.
YM2413 is well known as low-cost FM sound chip, and was used on Sega
Master System and FM-PAC sound expansion cartridge for MSX. VST2413
can resemble that warm texture of sound and may be well suited for
use in "post 8-bit era style" chiptune music.
