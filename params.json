Windows support is in the plan for the future.\r\n- VST plug-in only. No Audio Units support, and I don't know whether it should.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgement\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nAn implementation of YM2413 emulator (emu2413.c) used in this software\r\nis created by Mitsutaka Okazaki. A BIG THANKS goes to him.\r\n","name":"VST2413","tagline":"FM synthesizer based on YM2413 (OPLL) sound chip emulator"}
